***Oasis Infobyte Java Internship - Number Guessing Game***

Welcome to the ***Oasis Infobyte Java Internship!*** In this repository, you will find the code for the Number Guessing Game implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This game allows the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

Game Rules
The game will prompt you to enter the range of numbers within which you want to guess. You need to provide the lower and upper bounds for the range.

Next, you will be asked to enter the number of chances you want to have to guess the correct number. The more chances you select, the higher your chances of winning the game.

Once the game starts, you will be prompted to enter your guesses one by one. The game will provide feedback after each guess, informing you whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.

The objective is to guess the correct number within the selected number of chances. To win the game, you need to score more than half of the total chances available.

After the game ends, the program will display the result, indicating whether you won or lost and how many points you you score.
